Right click on server.js file run integrated terminal

npm i

npm init -y

## Usage

To initialize the app, right-click on the db/ directory and open the integrated terminal. Start the mysql dependency with this command:

```
mysql -u root
```

To create the tables copy the absolute path of the schema.sql. Then type in source in the terminal and paste the path:

```
source: <file path to schema.sql>
```

If you would like to seed the table with the created values, then copy the "absolute path" to seed.sql and run this in the terminal:

```
source: <file path to seed.sql>
```

Then exit mysql

```
exit
```

Next we want to seed the data

```
npm run seed
```

To view the tables and edit their content, run the following command:

```
node server.js
```
